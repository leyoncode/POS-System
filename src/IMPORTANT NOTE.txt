This project was created in sclipse ide and that is the preferred ide -mostly because it's free.

To run this project you need OpenJDK8 with JavaFX provided inside it.
Some newer versions of java don't include JavaFX in them as Oracle separated JavaFX from the main Java SDK.

We used Amazon Coretto 8. This is a free OpenJDK distribution and includes JavaFX in it. It's newer version does not include JavaFX, so stick with Java8 for this project for simplicity.
